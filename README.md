## Questions & Tasks

 * Compare the number of streams on Spotify, YouTube, and Pandora for top-ranked songs.
 * Identify songs that are popular on TikTok but have lower popularity on YouTube.
 * Check if there is correlation of track popularity across different platforms.

## Sketches

![Scatterplot](https://github.com/JiarongF/dataviz-project-proposal/blob/master/scatterplot.png)


This scatterplot visualizes the relationship between the number of views on YouTube and TikTok for various tracks. It aims to explore whether there is a positive correlation, indicating that songs popular on YouTube also tend to receive a higher number of likes on TikTok.


![Barplot](https://github.com/JiarongF/dataviz-project-proposal/blob/master/barplot.png)


This bar plot displays the streaming numbers for the top 10 most popular songs across different platforms. Each bar represents a specific platform, and the height indicates the total stream count for a particular song. This visualization provides a comparative view of how these top tracks perform across multiple platforms, highlighting which platforms contribute the most to a song's overall popularity.


![Heatmap](https://github.com/JiarongF/dataviz-project-proposal/blob/master/heatmap.png)


This plot visualizes the correlation of different variables in this dataset. The color's intensity represents the correlation's strength, with darker shades indicating stronger positive or negative correlations.


## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a scatterplot and it shows YouTube views vs TikTok views. Different color represents different artist. When you hover over each circle, the artist's name is displayed.

## Open Questions

Thanks for the valuable feedback from Curran! I really like the idea of text embedding, and I think the log transformation would be a great addition to my project. It's a very insightful suggestion, and Iâ€™ll definitely try to incorporate it once I get past midterms (a bit tied up with those at the moment).

## Milestones

- **Week 8** - Experiment with text embedding and log transformation
- **Week 9** - Check if incorporating other music datasets from different years is necessary
- **Week 10** - Bar plot implementation
- **Week 11** - Heatmap implementation
- **Week 12** - Add tooltips if necessary
- **Week 13** - Finalize plots
- **Week 14** - Write the report
