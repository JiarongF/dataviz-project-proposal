 * Check if there is correlation of track popularity across different platforms.

## Sketches

![Scatterplot](https://github.com/JiarongF/dataviz-project-proposal/blob/master/scatterplot.png)

This scatterplot visualizes the relationship between the number of likes on YouTube and TikTok for various tracks. It aims to explore whether there is a positive correlation, indicating that songs popular on YouTube also tend to receive a higher number of likes on TikTok.


![Barplot](https://github.com/JiarongF/dataviz-project-proposal/blob/master/scatterplot.png)

This bar plot displays the streaming numbers for the top 10 most popular songs across different platforms. Each bar represents a specific platform, and the height indicates the total stream count for a particular song. This visualization provides a comparative view of how these top tracks perform across multiple platforms, highlighting which platforms contribute the most to a song's overall popularity.

This plot visualizes the correlation of different variables in this dataset. The color's intensity represents the correlation's strength, with darker shades indicating stronger positive or negative correlations.


## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

## Open Questions

Thanks for the valuable feedback from Curran! I really like the idea of text embedding, and I think the log transformation would be a great addition to my project. It's a very insightful suggestion, and Iâ€™ll definitely try to incorporate it once I get past midterms (a bit tied up with those at the moment).

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
